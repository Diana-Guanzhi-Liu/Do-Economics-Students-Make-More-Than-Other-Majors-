#### Download Data ####
# The replication package can be found here: https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/126941/version/V1/view
# Since the original paper has constructed and cleaned the data for us, we will only need to upload the data we need to the inputs/raw data folder
# The data files we need are "/126941-V1/Data/Derived/ACS_Data_UCSCEcon_NAICS.Rda", "126941-V1/Data/Raw/DEGFIELD_Code_and_Label.xlsx" and "126941-V1/Data/Raw/NAICS2_to_Names.csv"
