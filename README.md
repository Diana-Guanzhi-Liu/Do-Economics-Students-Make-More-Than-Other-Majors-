# Overview
This paper investigates the financial returns associated with different college majors, shedding light on the income differences among arts, sciences, business, and applied science disciplines. By examining mean and median incomes across these majors, the study identifies applied science majors as yielding the highest returns, followed by business, arts, and science majors. Furthermore, the analysis delves into the influence of preferred industries on income differences, revealing that while business majors tend to gravitate towards higher-paying sectors such as finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE), arts and science majors often find themselves in lower-paying industries like public administration and construction. Notably, applied science majors, despite preferring the construction industry, exhibit superior earnings, suggesting a capacity to secure high-paying positions within a traditionally lower-paying industry due to above average knowledge from relevant coursework. This paper reiterates the pivotal role of undergraduate major choice in shaping future income trajectories, offering insights for prospective students navigating educational and career decisions.
