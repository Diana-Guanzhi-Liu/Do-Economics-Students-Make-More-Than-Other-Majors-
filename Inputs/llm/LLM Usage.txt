write an abstract based on the intro to this paper: The returns to college major refers to the additional income one would expect to earn by attaining a bachelors degree, and the majority of college and university students cite returns as one of the main reasons for choosing their degree, but which majors have the highest returns?

In the results section we examine the mean and median incomes of four categories of college majors: arts, sciences, business, and applied science, and rank them from highest to lowest returns. Then examine whether or not the differences in mean income among majors can be explained by their preferred industry of employment. This is done through analyzing each major's preferred industry and the mean income of said industry, examining whether or not the mean income of the preferred industries coincide with the mean income of the major.

In the discussion section, we found that applied science majors had the highest returns with mean wage income of 59636 USD, followed by business 55104, arts 45699, and science 45427. Some of the returns can be explained by preferred industry. Business majors preferred the finance insurance and real-estate industry (FIRE) which is the highest paying industry with a mean income of 57802 USD. Arts and Science majors preferred the public administration, FIRE, and construction industries. Public administration and construction are the two lowest paying industries with mean income of 43075 45514 respectively, coinciding with the mean income of arts and science majors. An explanation to why their preference for the FIRE industry did not increase mean income for arts and science majors is that they hold lower paying positions in the industry than business majors due to a lack of relevant coursework and knowledge. Applied science majors earn the highest mean income but prefer the construction industry which has low mean income. This is likely due to applied science majors holding high paying positions within a low paying industry as they have more knowledge and training from coursework than the average worker in the industry.

The analysis also suggests that the choice of undergraduate major has a similar impact on income as the choice of enrolling in an undergraduate degree. By knowing which majors have the highest earned income, prospective students will be able to better plan their education around their financial goals. Policy makers can use the choice of major as a key decision point where they can intervene to substantially impact long-run labour market composition and outcomes.

Abstract:

The pursuit of higher education is often motivated by the expectation of increased earnings potential, with college majors playing a pivotal role in shaping future income prospects. This study delves into the question of which majors yield the highest returns in terms of income, analyzing data encompassing arts, sciences, business, and applied science disciplines. Through an examination of mean and median incomes across these categories, we identify applied science majors as yielding the highest returns, followed by business, arts, and science majors. Further investigation reveals that differences in mean incomes among majors can be partially explained by their preferred industries of employment. While business majors gravitate towards high-paying sectors such as finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE), arts and science majors often find themselves in lower-paying industries like public administration and construction. Interestingly, despite the preference of applied science majors for the construction industry, their superior earnings suggest a capacity to secure high-paying positions within traditionally lower-paying sectors, underscoring the impact of specialized coursework and knowledge. Our findings underscore the significance of undergraduate major choice in shaping future income trajectories, akin to the decision to pursue higher education itself. Such insights can empower prospective students to align their educational aspirations with financial goals, while also informing policymakers seeking to influence long-term labor market dynamics.

Overview:

This paper investigates the financial returns associated with different college majors, shedding light on the income differentials among arts, sciences, business, and applied science disciplines. By examining mean and median incomes across these categories, the study identifies applied science majors as yielding the highest returns, followed by business, arts, and science majors, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis delves into the influence of preferred industries on income differentials, revealing that while business majors tend to gravitate towards higher-paying sectors such as finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE), arts and science majors often find themselves in lower-paying industries like public administration and construction. Notably, applied science majors, despite preferring the construction industry, exhibit superior earnings, suggesting a capacity to secure high-paying positions within traditionally lower-paying sectors. The study underscores the pivotal role of undergraduate major choice in shaping future income trajectories, offering insights for prospective students navigating educational and career decisions, as well as policymakers seeking to impact long-term labor market dynamics.
